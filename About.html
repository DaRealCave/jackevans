  <div id="div1" class="fluid"><h1>Jack Evans’s work focuses on the ever shrinking gap between the virtual reality we experience through technology and the real world. He depicts his ideas using the mediums of Video, Photography and Installations. He explores this topic through Absurdism, Accelerationism, Anxiety, Existentialism, Mortality, Politics, Phenomenology and mostly puts the subject in the context of himself and his experience of going through this world as ‘Neurodiverse’. He continuously sees himself as ‘Rebuilding’ to get by in this reality. This is explored in his continuing series called ‘Rebuild’, which focuses on shifts in his personal Ideologies, the way he perceives the world and his mental health at the time of the piece's creation.
